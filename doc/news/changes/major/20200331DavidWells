Improved: IBTK::FEDataManager, IBAMR::IBFEMethod, and IBAMR::IBFEMethod now only
associate elements with patches when an element intersects the patch plus a
ghost region of width 1 (previously we used a width large enough to accomodate
the IB stencil). This lowers the total number of elements used in velocity
interpolation and force spreading by about 25%.
