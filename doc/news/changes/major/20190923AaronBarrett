New: Added a polymeric fluid solver that can solve a Maxwell type fluid model.
Different fluid models can be implemented through a relaxation operator. The
solver currently solves for the conformation tensor, not the stress tensor. The
current assumption is that the relationship between the conformation tensor and
stress tensor is linear. Added several new examples demonstrating the
capabilities of the solver.
