New: Added the option to represent the jump fields plus the traction by 
discontinuous MONOMIAL or L2_LAGRANGE family. They will be used for structures with sharp corners/edges
and are tested for IIM/ex1 flow past a square block (2D and 3D), IIM/ex3 flow past a thin swimming airfoil, 
IIM/ex6 the Turek-Hron benchmark, and IIM/ex9 flexible plate inside the flow phantom.
