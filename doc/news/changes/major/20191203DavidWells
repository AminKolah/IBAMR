Removed: The old test suite based on gtest has been completely removed in favor
of the one based on attest. In particular:
<ol>
  <li>gtest is no longer recognized as a dependency.</li>
  <li><code>example.cpp</code> and <code>ex_main.cpp</code> have been brought
  back together.</li>
  <li>The <code>gtest</code> and <code>gtest-long</code> make targets have been
  removed.</li>
</ol>
