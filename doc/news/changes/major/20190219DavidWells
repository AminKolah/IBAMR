New: It is now possible to distribute computational workload in such a way that
the number of interaction points, rather than the number of Eulerian cells,
determines the per-processor allocation of cells. This can be done with the new
class IBTK::BoxPartitioner and is demonstrated in IBFE/explicit/ex4.
