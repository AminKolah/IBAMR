New: Added a new class IBTK::FischerGuess, which implements an algorithm for
estimating a solution to a linear system of equations based on a RHS and a
history of solution vectors and RHSs. This is now on by default in IBFE. A
benchmark based on IBFE/ex4 requires 75% fewer solver iterations with this class
and its default settings.
