Changed: Repartitioning of Lagrangian data now must be explicitly requested
inside IBFEMethod. The new default value is to never repartition the meshes
(instead of the old logic which used SAMRAI's partitioning whenever a load
balancer was attached). As a result the enum value
<tt>LibmeshPartitionerType::AUTOMATIC</tt> has been removed.
