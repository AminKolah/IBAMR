Changed: IBAMR::INSHierarchyIntegrator now computes the current CFL number via
IBAMR::INSHierarchyIntegrator::updateCurrentCFLNumber() and makes it available
via IBAMR::INSHierarchyIntegrator::getCurrentCFLNumber(). Classes which inherit
from INSHierarchyIntegrator need to implement updateCurrentCFLNumber() in a
compatible way.
