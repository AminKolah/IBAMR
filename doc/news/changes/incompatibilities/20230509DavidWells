Changed: Some functions in IBTK::HierarchyMathOps previously gained the ability
to interpolate data from ghost regions into ghost regions. These functions have
now been renamed as interp_ghosted() and harmonic_interp_ghosted() to
distinguish them from the interpolation functions which update the destination
coarse-fine interface.
