Improved: FEMechanicsBase (and therefore IBFEMethod) will evaluate all PK1
functions corresponding to the same registered libMesh systems and quadrature
rules inside a single loop, rather than independently looping over each PK1
function independently. This essentially eliminates the overhead of using
multiple PK1 stress functions.
